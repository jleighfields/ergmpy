# Security Scan

Find secrets and unsafe patterns before they get committed, and report a
findings list. **Report-only** — never edit or delete a secret yourself.
Removing a secret and (critically) **rotating** it is a deliberate,
human-driven step.

Run tooling first, the same way `code-quality-review` runs ruff, then cover
the remaining cases with `git` checks and `grep`:

1. **`ruff` `S` rules (flake8-bandit)** — mechanical insecure-pattern
   detection (hardcoded passwords, `eval`/`exec`, `shell=True`, unsafe
   deserialization). Configured in `pyproject.toml`.
2. **`detect-secrets`** — entropy + regex secret detection with a committed
   `.secrets.baseline` so known false positives stay suppressed.
3. **`git ls-files` + `grep`** — tracked-credential-file checks and a regex
   fallback for token shapes the tools miss.

Security scan findings answer "does this leak a credential or open a hole?"
`code-quality-review` answers "is it clear?" and `simplify-audit` answers
"should it exist?"

## Arguments

- **file-or-directory** (optional): Path to scan for secret *content* /
  insecure patterns. If omitted, scan the changed files
  (`git diff --name-only HEAD` unioned with `git ls-files --others
  --exclude-standard` — union, not fallback).
  The tracked-file checks always run against the whole repo regardless of
  the argument.

## Scope

- **Content / pattern scan:** the target files (changed files by default,
  or the given path).
- **Tracked-file checks:** always whole-repo via `git ls-files` — a
  committed `.env` is a repo-wide fact, not a diff fact.
- **Never scan gitignored or untracked artifacts** for content. Confirm
  with `git ls-files` rather than guessing from directory names — but DO
  still confirm those paths are actually ignored.

## What to check

### Tracked credential files (whole repo, always)

Run `git ls-files` and flag any tracked file that should never be committed:

- `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*` **except** `.env.example` / `.env.template`
  / `.env.sample` (those are intended templates — see the caveat below).
- Private keys / certs: `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.pfx`, `*.p12`, `*.keytab`,
  `id_rsa`, `id_dsa`.
- Credential dumps: `credentials.json`, `service-account*.json`,
  `*.kdbx`, `.netrc`, `.pgpass`, `.htpasswd`.

A tracked secret file is **Must Fix**: `git rm --cached` it, add it to
`.gitignore`, and **rotate** anything it exposed (it is already in history).

### `.gitignore` coverage

Confirm `.env` and the patterns above are gitignored, not merely absent. A
secret that is untracked today but not ignored can be committed by
`git add -A`.

### Hardcoded secrets — detect-secrets + grep fallback

Primary: run `detect-secrets` against the baseline (see Steps). It catches
token shapes AND high-entropy strings the regexes below would miss, and the
baseline suppresses audited false positives.

Fallback / supplement (also useful for explaining a finding): scan for
assignments of a secret-looking name to a literal, and known token shapes.
Pattern reference (ripgrep regex):

| What | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Secret-named literal | `(?i)(pass(word|wd)?\|secret\|token\|api[_-]?key\|client[_-]?secret\|access[_-]?key\|auth[_-]?token\|private[_-]?key)\s*[:=]\s*["'][^"']{6,}["']` |
| Private key block | `-----BEGIN (RSA \|EC \|OPENSSH \|DSA \|PGP )?PRIVATE KEY-----` |
| AWS access key id | `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}` |
| GitHub token | `gh[pousr]_[A-Za-z0-9]{36,}` or `github_pat_[A-Za-z0-9_]{60,}` |
| Slack token | `xox[baprs]-[A-Za-z0-9-]{10,}` |
| Bearer/JWT | `(?i)bearer\s+[A-Za-z0-9._\-]{20,}` / `eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_\-]{10,}\.eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_\-]{10,}` |
| URL with embedded creds | `[a-z][a-z0-9+.\-]*://[^/\s:@]+:[^/\s:@]+@` |
| Connection-string password | `(?i)(password\|pwd)=[^;"'\s]{4,}` |

For each hit, **redact the value in your report** — show the variable name
and first few characters only, never the full secret.

### Secrets passed to logging or print

ruff `S` does not cover this. Flag log and print statements that
interpolate a secret-bearing value: `Authorization` headers, anything named
`*secret*` / `*token*` / `*password*`, or a whole `headers` / `auth` dict.
Even at DEBUG a logged token ends up in the deployment's log store, which
is usually retained longer and read by more people than the code.

### Insecure patterns — ruff `S` rules

`ruff check --select S` reports these patterns; cite the rule code in each
finding (as `code-quality-review` cites ruff codes):

- **Hardcoded password** — `S105` (string), `S106` (func arg), `S107`
  (default arg).
- **`eval` / `exec`** — `S307` (eval), `S102` (exec).
- **Unsafe deserialization** — `S301` (`pickle`), `S506` (`yaml.load`
  without `SafeLoader`).
- **Shell injection surface** — `S602`/`S604`/`S605` (`shell=True`),
  `S607` (partial executable path).
- **TLS verification disabled** — `S501` (`verify=False`).
- **Other** — `S104` (bind all interfaces), `S324` (weak hash).

Treat any `S`-rule hit on the target files as **at least Should Fix**;
`S105-S107` (hardcoded secret) is **Must Fix**. Do not re-flag the
configured ignores below.

## Configured exceptions (don't re-flag these)

`pyproject.toml` encodes the legitimate exceptions and `.secrets.baseline`
records audited non-secrets — respect both. **Read the actual per-file
ignores in `pyproject.toml` rather than assuming**; they are the authority,
and this section describes only the fleet default.

- **`tests/**` ignores `S101` only.** pytest tests use `assert`, so
  `S101` is expected there. **The hardcoded-secret rules `S105-S107` stay
  ACTIVE in tests**, because a real credential pasted into a fixture is
  exactly as leaked as one in production code. Never suppress an
  `S105-S107` hit under `tests/` as a configured exception — it is a
  **Must Fix**.

## Repo-specific caveats

- **There is no `.env` here and none is expected.** Nothing in this project
  authenticates to anything: every input is one of the two CSVs committed
  under `reference/`, and nothing is read from a remote service. `.gitignore`
  covers the pattern defensively, so a tracked `.env` appearing is a real
  finding rather than the usual false positive, and there is no
  `.env.example` to audit.
- **RNG seeds and fitted coefficients are not credentials.** The sampler
  seeds exist so a run reproduces, and the estimates under `results/` are the
  output this repo exists to produce. Both are meant to be committed and
  read; a high-entropy-looking float in a results file is a parameter.
- **The input data is the authors' published tutorial data.** `reference/`
  holds two CSVs of anonymized customer choices released with the paper, so
  a fixture that looks like customer records carries nothing to leak. A file
  appearing to hold *identified* respondents is the exception worth flagging.

Each caveat has to be anchored to something durable: a file that exists, a
documented convention. A caveat naming a deleted module authorizes an
exception that no longer applies.

## Output format

Group findings by severity, same buckets as `code-quality-review` so the
`code-reviewer` agent's report stays uniform. **Number findings
sequentially**, continuing from the review findings rather than restarting
at 1, so a closing list of open items is unambiguous about which section
each belongs to.

### Must Fix
- Confirmed live secret in code, a tracked `.env`/key file, a real value
  in `.env.example`, or an `S105-S107` hit. **Always include the
  remediation:** remove it, move it to an environment variable / `.env`,
  and **rotate the exposed credential** — state explicitly that
  working-tree removal is not enough if it was ever committed, since it
  persists in git history; scrub with `git filter-repo` / BFG if needed.

### Should Fix
- Other insecure-pattern `S`-rule hits (`verify=False`, `eval`/`exec`,
  unsafe deserialization, `shell=True`) and secret logging.

### Consider
- Possible-but-uncertain matches (entropy hits not in the baseline that
  might be fixtures), `.gitignore` gaps with nothing currently leaked.

For each finding: a sequential number, `file:line`, the rule code where
applicable, what matched (**redacted**), why it is a risk, and the
suggested fix.

## Steps

1. **Pick targets.** Path argument → that path. Otherwise
   `git diff --name-only HEAD` unioned with `git ls-files --others
   --exclude-standard`. Union, not fallback — see `code-quality-review`.
   The tracked-file and `.gitignore` checks run whole-repo regardless.
2. **Mechanical passes first** — reuse the configured tooling:
   - `uv run ruff check --select S <targets>` — insecure patterns. Cite
     each rule code.
   - `uv run detect-secrets-hook --baseline .secrets.baseline <targets>` —
     entropy/regex secret detection. The `-hook` entry point **reads** the
     baseline to suppress audited false positives, then exits non-zero and
     prints each new secret's type and location. Crucially it **does not
     rewrite `.secrets.baseline`** — unlike `detect-secrets scan
     --baseline .secrets.baseline`, which rewrites the file in place AND
     drops the recorded entries for every file outside `<targets>`, wiping
     audited false positives for everything unscanned. Treat every
     reported hit as a candidate and open it to confirm a real secret
     versus a placeholder or fixture.
   - **Check the baseline is there and intact before trusting a clean
     run.** It must exist, be tracked, and still carry its detector list.
     If it is missing or truncated, treat the scan as invalid even when the
     hook exits cleanly; a clean exit then does not prove the detector list
     or audited false positives were used.
   - **This skill is report-only: never modify `.secrets.baseline`.**
     Recording a new audited false positive (via `scan` plus an
     interactive `detect-secrets audit`) is a deliberate, separate human
     step — and **never** commit a real secret into the baseline to
     silence it. If the baseline shows as modified after a scan, restore
     it with `git checkout -- .secrets.baseline`.
   - **When you report a false positive, recommend the inline fix, not the
     baseline.** Marking the line `# pragma: allowlist secret` with the
     reason beside it clears the hit and keeps the reason beside the code.
     A baseline entry stores a hash without the reason it was allowed. So
     the recorded findings should be zero; the baseline should carry the
     detector list and the exclude pattern, not accumulated exceptions.
     Recommend excluding a whole file only where its values change on every
     run, since those are stale in a baseline by the next commit.
   - **Regenerating it deliberately keeps the exclude pattern**, which is
     not carried forward from the existing file:

     ```bash
     uv run detect-secrets scan --exclude-files 'manifest\.json$' > .secrets.baseline
     ```

     Dropping the flag brings back findings that change on every run, and a
     value that changes every run is stale in the baseline by the next
     commit — exclude the file instead. This repo's case is `results/`, whose
     fitted coefficients and timings change with every measurement. Commit
     the result: the pattern is stored *in* the baseline as a filter, so
     every later caller inherits it without repeating the flag.
3. **Tracked-file check.** `git ls-files`, filtered for the credential-file
   patterns above, applying the `.env.example` exception. Confirm
   `.gitignore` coverage.
4. **Fallback content scan.** Run the grep patterns over the target files
   for anything the tools did not surface, then check for secret logging.
   Open each hit to confirm it is a real secret versus a placeholder or
   fixture; redact before reporting.
5. **Emit the report** grouped by severity. Make **no edits** — this skill
   is report-only. If anything is Must Fix, lead with it. If there are no
   findings, say "No security findings" explicitly so the clean result is
   on record.

## Note on the R baseline

`benchmarks/r/` and the generated `rlib/` are R, which `ruff` does not read.
`rlib/` is untracked and out of scope. `bench.R` is tracked and short enough
to read by hand; it opens no network connection and reads only the committed
CSVs.
